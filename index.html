          As between you and Investor Nations, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including without limitation patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, service marks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and any goodwill associated with the Service, are owned by Investor Nations. For instance, we own any design or product features inherent in the Service, such as the way that data is organized, curated, presented, and delivered, and any know-how or other intellectual property inherent in the way we have to create, provide, display or make available the Service.

        <div class="tcboldtext">
          9.  Special terms for use of customer personal data or output data about European data subjects
        </div>    
        <div class="tctext">
          You may receive Output Data regarding data subjects who reside in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (“European Data Subjects”) (such as their name, job title, or contact information), which we refer to below as European Output Data.” If you do so, you agree that you will use the Output Data only in the following situations, in addition to complying with other consent or permission requirements set out in this Section:<br>
          <ol>
            <br>
            <li>
              pursuant to explicit consent from the data subject of the Output Data, sufficient to comply with the consent requirements of GDPR.
            </li>
            <li>
              for other purposes you have established are necessary to pursue your legitimate interests in the context of business-to-business relationships and in compliance with the GDPR and all other legal requirements. For instance, if you use the Output Data to contact actual or prospective business partners, you may need to obtain consent for “prospecting” by means of a telephone, fax machine, or email.
            </li>
            <br>
          </ol>
          When you receive or use European Output Data, you understand and agree that you are the data controller, and we are your data processor, as those terms are used under the GDPR. You will obtain from each data subject (e.g., the persons in your customer database) all required consents (or establish another basis for processing the Output Data, if applicable), make available all required data subject rights, and otherwise, comply with all provisions of the GDPR and other European data protection rules applicable to data controllers.<br>
          To the extent that Investor Nations processes any Customer Personal Data (as defined in the Investor Nations Processing Agreement) that is subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or other applicable European data protection rules, on the Customer’s behalf, in the provision of the services hereunder, the terms of the Investor Nations Data Processing Agreement, which are hereby incorporated by reference, shall apply. For customers that are located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or the European Economic Area, the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, attached to the Data Processing Agreement, with Investor Nations, which provide adequate safeguards with respect to the personal data processed by us under this Agreement and pursuant to the provisions of our Data Processing Agreement apply.<br>
          This Section 9 supersedes and takes precedence over any separate agreement or terms that we may enter into with you, regarding any data licensed from you to us, or from us to you.<br>
          Required Consumer Consents and Permissions. In some countries or jurisdictions, additional consents, notices, and permissions may be required for certain types of marketing or processing of personal information. Client understands that, while Provider seeks to comply with its own legal obligations, Provider has not obtained any rights or consents on Client’s behalf: therefore, to the extent that any law or regulation may require that Client (in addition to Provider) provide notice or obtain consent in order to market to any person or process any person’s personal data, Client agrees that Client shall obtain on Client’s own behalf such notices or consents.<br>

          We, or service providers working with us, may monitor the Service for any legitimate business purpose, including to monitor compliance with these Terms or evaluate how the Service is being accessed and used. We will be the sole and final arbiter as to whether the Service is being misused or these Terms are being violated. If we believe you have violated these Terms (or any law) we may terminate your account and access to the Service and any Output Data immediately and without notice. In such a situation we also may seek civil, criminal, or injunctive relief, at its sole discretion and without obligation, to enforce this Terms of Service and the law.

          YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICE ALONG WITH THE OUTPUT DATA IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES (1) OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (2) OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OR ACCURACY, (3) OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, (4) OF PERFORMANCE, (5) OF TITLE, (6) THAT THE SERVICE WILL OPERATE IN AN ERROR-FREE, TIMELY, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED MANNER, IS CURRENT AND UP TO DATE AND ACCURATELY DESCRIBES ANYTHING, OR IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, (7) THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED, (8) THAT THE SERVICE IS COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PARTICULAR HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE PLATFORM, OR (9) THAT WE WILL ENFORCE THE TERMS OF SERVICE AGAINST OTHERS TO YOUR SATISFACTION. EFFORTS BY INVESTOR NATIONS TO MODIFY THE SERVICE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A WAIVER OF THESE LIMITATIONS OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. Some jurisdictions limit or don’t allow the disclaimer of implied warranties – in those states, these warranties will be disclaimed only to the fullest extent permitted by law.

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE (EXCLUSIVE OF PAYMENT OR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS) EXCEED THE TOTAL OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY EITHER PARTY TO THE OTHER DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS. ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS BY INVESTOR NATIONS MAY APPEAR WITHIN THE SERVICE AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DISCLAIMERS PLACE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN, SUCH GREATER RESTRICTIONS SHALL APPLY. Some jurisdictions restrict or do not allow the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. In cases where such laws apply, the liability of the Investor Nations Entities shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

                  Binding Arbitration. If we do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of ten (10) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then we both agree to resolve by arbitration any and all controversies, claims, or disputes arising out of, relating to or resulting from (1) your relationship with us, (2) these Terms of Service, (3) any other aspect of the Service. These Terms of Service are intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that lawfully can be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of these Terms of Service are expressly excluded from Section 14.

                <br>
                <li>

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action on an individual (not class or representative action) basis in state or federal court or in Estonia and Trademark Office to protect its patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights.

                </li>

              Governing law<br>
              The Terms of Service and the relationship between you and Investor Nations shall be governed in all respects by the laws of Estonia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any claim or dispute either of us may have against the other that is not subject to arbitration must be resolved by a court located in Tallinn, Estonia. We both agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Tallinn, Estonia for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes that are not subject to arbitration.
